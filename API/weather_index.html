<h1>What's the Weather Like?</h1>
<h2>Part I - WeatherPy</h2>

<p><strong>Research question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"</strong> 

<p>Will show a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
		<li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
		<li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
		<li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
	</ul>

<p>Next will show a series of scatter plots with a linear regression of the same cities and weather analysis but showcasing the following relationships according to the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere</p>

<p> Summary Description of each plot </p>

<h3>Findings and Observations: Weather and Latitude</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude: Data shows that the closer the latitude is to 0°, the higher the temperature</li>
	<li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude: Data shows that there is no correlation visible</li>
	<li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude: Data shows that there are pockets where there is a maximum percent of cloudiness and zero percent of cloudiness. About 0 percent of clouds were areas with a 20° to 60° latitude range and high maximum cloudiness percent were areas with -20° to 0° and 40° to 70° latitude range.</li>
	<li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude: Data shows that there is no correlation visible. However there was an outlier for maximum wind speed around 70° latitude for the random data set that included this data point.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Findings and Observations: Weather and Southern vs Northern Hemisphere</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude:  There is a strong to moderate correlation between Latitude coordinate and Temperature. The closer to the equator(0°) the higher the temperature, the further away from the equator temperature decreases.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Humidity.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Cloudiness. However, there are pocket areas where there were a maximum percent of cloudiness between 0° to -20° in the Southern Hemisphere and 60° to 70° in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Wind Speed. However, there was an outlier that had the maximum wind speed which was Lakselv, Norway at around 70° latitude for the random data set that included this data point.</li>
</ul>
