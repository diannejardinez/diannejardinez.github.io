<h1>Visualizations</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude:  There is a strong to moderate correlation between Latitude coordinate and Temperature. The closer to the equator(0°) the higher the temperature, the further away from the equator temperature decreases.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Humidity.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Cloudiness. However, there are pocket areas where there were a maximum percent of cloudiness between 0° to -20° in the Southern Hemisphere and 60° to 70° in the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
	<li>Northern and Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude: There was a weak to no correlation between Latitude coordinate and Wind Speed. However, there was an outlier that had the maximum wind speed which was Lakselv, Norway at around 70° latitude for the random data set that included this data point.</li>
</ul>
