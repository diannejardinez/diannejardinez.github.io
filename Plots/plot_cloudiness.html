<h1>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</h1>
<h2>Findings and Observations</h2>


<p>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude: Data shows that there are pockets where there is a maximum percent of cloudiness and zero percent of cloudiness. About 0 percent of clouds were areas with a 20° to 60° latitude range and high maximum cloudiness percent were areas with -20° to 0° and 40° to 70° latitude range.</p>
